I want to improve how I use Claude Code for this MCP server project. Please:

1. Review my current CLAUDE.md file and suggest improvements
2. Check my .claude/settings.json for best practices
3. Suggest useful hooks that would help with MCP development
4. Recommend custom slash commands for common workflows
5. Share any Claude Code features I might not be using

Focus on practical improvements specific to:
- MCP server development and testing
- Docker-based workflows
- Webhook debugging
- Voice call testing

Use the claude-code-expert agent if available, or fetch the Claude Code docs from https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt for reference.
